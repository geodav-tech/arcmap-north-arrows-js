In geography school, I was taught that every map must have a north arrow, despite how ridiculous this can be when it's totally obvious where north is. This rule seems to have been (rightfully) lost in the modern age of digital maps.

But don't you sometimes miss the simple days when GIS was mostly desktop-based maps and you could slap a big ol' north arrow on them?

Are you not at all concerned that Esri North 9, the [comic sans of cartography](https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1fcnj3/comment/ca8yk03/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), is unrecognizable to a new generation of mappers?

Well worry not! A hand-curated selection of classic ArcMap 9.3 north arrows could still grace your maps, even on the web!
